# WeatherCheck

# Console application for pulling dynamic weather information for a static list of U.S. cities.

# Note: inquirer does not work properly in PyCharm. The script must be called from the console to work properly --> python3 main.py

# All current_weather data comes from an API provided by open-meteo.com.
